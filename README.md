## Introduction

The double inverse pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory. This simulation models the motion of a double inverse pendulum using a set of differential equations and visualizes the results.

## Installation

To run this simulation, you need to have Python installed. You also need the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine and run the simulation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/double-inverse-pendulum.git
cd double-inverse-pendulum
python simulation.py
```
